## What's hierarchical task network planning?

To understand what's I'm about to describe in further sections, I highly recomend you to familiarize yourself with at least one of the following sources:
* [AI and Games video about use of HTN planning in Transformers: Fall of Cybertron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXm467TFTcY);
* [Game AI Pro chapter about HTN](http://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro/GameAIPro_Chapter12_Exploring_HTN_Planners_through_Example.pdf);
* [Edinburgh University lectures about AI planning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vy8970q0Xc&list=PLwJ2VKmefmxpUJEGB1ff6yUZ5Zd7Gegn2).
