# Hierarchical-Task-Network-planner-for-Unity
Hello. I want to present to you my HTN planner for Unity.
Basically, it is a set of scripts I use to program my NPC's behaviour.

Before you strat, I highly recomend to check out the [project documentation](https://github.com/KrylovBoris/Hierarchical-Task-Network-planner-for-Unity/blob/master/documentation/_table_of_contents.md). It will provide you a good idea on how this system works and how to properly use it.

If you just want to get started here is [a quick guide](https://github.com/KrylovBoris/Hierarchical-Task-Network-planner-for-Unity/blob/master/documentation/integration-in-unity-project.md).
